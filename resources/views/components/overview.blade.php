                <p>Tailwind makes writing CSS easier and lets us customize our designs faster than any other CSS
                    framework. If you want a CSS framework that has pre-built components, then Tailwind may not be for
                    you. If you want a CSS framework that lets you design quickly and customize your site, then <strong
                        class="font-bold text-teal-500">Tailwind
                        is gonna be a lot of fun.</strong></p>
                <p>After using Bulma to build <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Scotch.io</a>, my CSS files
                    became littered with my own <code
                        class="inlineblock px-1 rounded text-sm font-mono text-red-300">!important</code> classes to
                    override the framework's styles. Tailwind doesn't have the <code
                        class="inlineblock px-1 rounded text-sm font-mono text-red-300">!important</code> since all our
                    elements
                    are designed on the fly.</p>
                <p>Important Note: Tailwind lets us design quickly, but this doesn't mean that you don't need CSS
                    knowledge however. To use Tailwind, you need to have a good understanding of CSS properties. In this
                    course, we will learn Tailwind and we'll also learn CSS concepts to create good looking designs.
                    Tailwind is the ultimate CSS shorthand, but we still need to learn the CSS, which we'll do in this
                    course.</p>
                <p>This isn't just a Tailwind course. This is also a "learn how to design with CSS" course.
                </p>
                <p>The hardest things about learning Tailwind is memorizing the classes and also knowing which classes
                    go well together. We'll be writing a lot of Tailwind in this course so that the repetition will help
                    us commit Tailwind classes to memory.</p>
